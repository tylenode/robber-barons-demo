            Housing as a wealth building asset has lead to the <b>subtle monopolization</b> of markets in Boston. Homeownership has long been a <b>reliable</b> means of generating generational wealth in the U.S., but as corporations buy up homes and drive prices out of reach, that opportunity <b>disappears</b> for many residents. In Boston, <b>long time homeowners struggle</b> to downsize their homes and are often <b>caressed</b> into selling to investment firms well under market price. <b>Prospective homeowners</b> entering the market further struggle to compete, having little ability to out-bid investors. 

            <br><br>

            <b>Corporate housing ownership is bad</b> for Boston's residents <b>across the board</b>. 

            <br><br> 

            By supporting <b>local legislation</b>, <b>rent control</b>, <b>affordable housing initiatives</b>, and <b>community land trusts</b>, individuals can help preserve <b>housing for people</b>, <b>not profit</b>. Getting involved in tenant unions, backing local candidates who prioritize housing justice, and raising awareness through grassroots organizing can all <b>push back against the growing trend of corporate control</b> over Bostonâ€™s neighborhoods.
